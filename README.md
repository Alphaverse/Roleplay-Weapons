# Roleplay-Weapons
The weapon pack to use with the [Roleplay Gamemode](https://github.com/Arkten/Roleplay). It works in Sandbox and Base gamemodes but was not intended for these.
To add a weapon you simply copy an existing weapon and modify the values you want to change. Take a look at what values you can change in `example_weapon.lua`.

`sounds.txt` includes some useful weapon soundscripts that work in Garry's Mod.
Please respect the code styling when editing files.
